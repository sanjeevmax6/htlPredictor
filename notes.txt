One of the potential pitfalls of working with small data is ensuring
representative splitting into test and training data sets. For example,
relatively few studies are published that include low-yield data, which
means that random splitting into test and training sets may result in a
training set that completely lacks low-yield data. The result is a model
that cannot accurately predict data with low yields. To prevent the
problem of nonrepresentative data splitting, the data set was stratified
based on yield prior to splitting. Stratification grouped data by
reported oil yield to create a set of bins each with an equal number of
data points (10 here). During splitting, at least one data point from
each bin was included in the test set to ensure that it was
representative of the full range of data present in the training set. The
data were then rerandomized prior to training and validation.
